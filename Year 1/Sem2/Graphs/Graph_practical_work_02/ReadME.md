___

# BONUSðŸ¥‡:



### 1B. **Strongly-Connected Components**

Write a program that finds the strongly-connected components of a directed graph in , where:

 is the number of vertices.

 is the number of arcs.

___

### 2B. **Biconnected Components**

___
### 3B. Shortest Path Problems 

Use a lowest-length path algorithm and a new implementation of the interface from Lab 1 to solve any of the following problems:

Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem

A man has a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage and must cross a river in a boat that can hold only him and one other item. He cannot leave the wolf alone with the goat or the goat alone with the cabbage. Find the shortest sequence of moves to cross the river.

Cannibals and Missionaries Problem

Three cannibals and three missionaries must cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people. It is not allowed to have, at any moment and on any bank, the missionaries outnumbered by the cannibals (unless no missionaries exist on that bank at that time). Find the shortest sequence of moves to cross the river.

Jealous Husbands Problem

Three married couples must cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people. No woman can be in the presence of another man (on a bank or in the boat) unless her husband is also present. Find the shortest sequence of moves to cross the river.
